# What is `self` Keyword in Python
`Arbisoft`

In Python, the self keyword is a convention used to represent the instance of a class within the class itself. It is the first parameter in the method definition of a class and is used to refer to the instance of the class.

When you define a method inside a class, you use self as the first parameter to reference the instance on which the method is called. This allows you to access the attributes and methods of that particular instance.

Here's a simple example:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def print_value(self):
        print(self.value)

# Creating an instance of MyClass
obj = MyClass(42)

# Calling the print_value method on the instance
obj.print_value()  # This will print: 42
```

In the above example, self refers to the instance of the MyClass class. The __init__ method is a special method called when an instance of the class is created, and self.value is an instance variable that stores the value passed during initialization.

Note that while self is a convention and not a strict requirement, it is widely used and helps make the code more readable and maintainable by clearly indicating that you are working with instance variables or methods within a class.
