# You Have To Correctly Label, 3 Wrongly Labeled Bags In 1 Try (Pick 1 Ball From Any Bag).1 Of Them(M) Has Mix Red Or Black Balls, One Has Only Red(R) And One Has Only Black(B) Balls.

To solve this problem in one try, you can follow these steps:

1-  Pick a ball from the bag labeled "Mix" (M). Since this bag is labeled incorrectly, it must contain either all red or all black balls.

- If you pick a red ball, then the bag labeled "Mix" (M) actually contains only red balls, and the bag labeled "Red" (R) must be the one with mixed red and black balls.

- If you pick a black ball, then the bag labeled "Mix" (M) actually contains only black balls, and the bag labeled "Black" (B) must be the one with mixed red and black balls.

Thus, in one try, you can correctly label all three bags.
