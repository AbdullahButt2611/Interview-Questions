# What is the difference between a GET and POST request?

### GET Request

1. **Purpose**: Used to request data from a specified resource.
2. **Data Handling**: Sends data as query parameters appended to the URL. For example: `http://example.com/page?name=John&age=30`.
3. **Visibility**: Data is visible in the URL, which can be bookmarked or shared. This makes it less secure for sensitive data.
4. **Idempotence**: GET requests are idempotent, meaning they should not change the state of the server. Multiple identical GET requests should produce the same result.
5. **Caching**: Responses to GET requests can be cached by browsers or intermediary servers, improving performance for frequently accessed resources.
6. **Length Limitation**: URLs have a length limit, so GET requests are not suitable for sending large amounts of data.

### POST Request

1. **Purpose**: Used to submit data to be processed by a specified resource, often resulting in a change in state or side effects on the server.
2. **Data Handling**: Sends data in the body of the request rather than in the URL. This is used for form submissions and data creation.
3. **Visibility**: Data is not visible in the URL, which is more secure for transmitting sensitive information, though not entirely secure on its own.
4. **Idempotence**: POST requests are not idempotent. Multiple identical POST requests can result in different outcomes (e.g., creating multiple records).
5. **Caching**: POST requests are generally not cached by default, which can be desirable for operations that change server state.
6. **Length Limitation**: There is no practical limit on the amount of data that can be sent in the body of a POST request, making it suitable for large amounts of data.

In summary, use GET for retrieving data and POST for submitting data that changes the server's state or involves sensitive information.
