You are working on an enterprise project for a bank. You have been assigned with Account Type module that deals with managing account types of customers. Account types can be Normal, Gold or Prefered. Which of the following is the most appropriate for this code block that you wrote in JavaScrip.

```javascript
class BankAccount {
    static changeAccountType(accountType) {
        this.newAccountType = accountType;
        return this.newAccountType;
    }
    constructor({
        newAccountType = "Normal"
    } = {}) {
        this.newAccountType = newAccountType;
    }
}

const customer = new BankAccount({
    newAccountType: "Gold"
});
console.log(customer.changeAccountType("Prefered"));
```

`Turing - JavaScript`

----

### What's happening

* You declared `changeAccountType` as a **static method**.
* **Static methods** belong to the class itself, not the instance.
  This means they cannot directly access instance properties like `this.newAccountType` unless you explicitly pass an instance to them.
* When you do:

  ```javascript
  customer.changeAccountType("Prefered");
  ```

  You're calling a static method **on an instance**, which will throw an error:
  **`TypeError: customer.changeAccountType is not a function`**
  because static methods are only accessible like:

  ```javascript
  BankAccount.changeAccountType("Prefered");
  ```


### Why this is inappropriate for your use case

You want **each customer account** to have its own account type and be able to change it.
That is an **instance-level behavior**, not a **class-level behavior**.


### Correct approach

You should remove `static` so that the method belongs to instances:

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  changeAccountType(accountType) {
    this.newAccountType = accountType;
    return this.newAccountType;
  }

  constructor({ newAccountType = "Normal" } = {}) {
    this.newAccountType = newAccountType;
  }
}

const customer = new BankAccount({ newAccountType: "Gold" });
console.log(customer.changeAccountType("Prefered")); // "Prefered"
```


âœ… **Most appropriate conclusion:**

> The method `changeAccountType` should be an **instance method**, not a **static method**, because changing account type is related to an individual customer account, not the whole `BankAccount` class.
