# Divide and Conquer

"Divide and conquer" is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. The idea is to tackle each smaller problem separately, solve them, and then combine the solutions to address the original, more complex issue. This approach is often employed in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, and military strategy. 

### Algorithm Design:

In computer science and algorithm design, "divide and conquer" is a common paradigm for designing efficient algorithms. The basic steps of this technique can be summarized as follows:

1. **Divide:** Break the problem into smaller sub-problems.
2. **Conquer:** Solve each sub-problem independently.
3. **Combine:** Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to solve the original problem.

This technique is frequently used to solve problems like sorting (e.g., Merge Sort, QuickSort), searching (e.g., Binary Search), and other optimization problems.
