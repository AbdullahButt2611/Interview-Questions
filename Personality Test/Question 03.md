One of my biggest challenges was developing [your product with a one liner description]. [Some highlighting feature of the product or unique sell point] <It involved balancing the nuances of language, visuals, and user experience to keep it both engaging and authentic>.
[Your difficulty in preparing that product or implementing a certain feature] <Initially, I struggled with integrating smooth animations and handling different assets effectively. I broke down the project step-by-step, researching best practices, testing various animation frameworks, and refining the visuals to match the mood of each poem.>

A huge part of tackling it was staying flexible. Iâ€™d seek feedback regularly, tweak the tool based on real-user insights, and kept experimenting until everything aligned seamlessly. It taught me the value of resilience, iterative improvements, and keeping the end-user experience front and center.
