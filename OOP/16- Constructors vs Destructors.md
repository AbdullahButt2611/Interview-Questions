# Constructors vs Destructors

In object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like C++ and some others, constructors and destructors are special member functions that are used for initializing and cleaning up objects, respectively.

## Constructor

- **Purpose:** Constructors are used to initialize the object. They are called automatically when an object is created.
- **Syntax (in C++):** They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type, not even void.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code here
    }
};
```

- **Multiple Constructors (Overloading):** You can have multiple constructors with different parameters (constructor overloading).
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Default constructor
    MyClass() {
        // Initialization code here
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    MyClass(int value) {
        // Initialization code with a parameter
    }
};
```

- **Initialization:** Constructors are responsible for setting initial values for the object's data members.

## Destructor

- **Purpose:** Destructors are used to clean up resources or perform other tasks before an object is destroyed.
- **Syntax (in C++):** They have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~) and do not have any parameters or return type.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        // Cleanup code here
    }
};
```
- **Automatic Invocation:** Destructors are called automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. They are also called when the program exits.
- **Resource Cleanup:** Destructors are often used to release resources like memory, file handles, or network connections acquired during the object's lifetime.
- **No Overloading:** Unlike constructors, you cannot have multiple destructors or overload them. A class can have only one destructor.

In summary, constructors initialize objects, while destructors clean up resources and perform finalization tasks when the object is no longer needed. They play crucial roles in managing the lifecycle of objects in object-oriented programming.
