## What causes are you passionate about. What efforts have you put in the cause.

I'm deeply passionate about creating accessible technology that empowers people, especially in underserved communities. Growing up with a background shaped by migration and reinvention, I’ve seen firsthand the power of resilience and opportunity. In my work, whether it’s building AI tools or platforms like [your best project], I’m intentional about making tech more inclusive. I volunteer time mentoring others, sharing my experiences to help them break into tech, and focus on developing solutions that are approachable and meaningful to diverse audiences.
