They’d probably say I was the one who embraced challenges head-on. I was always the person willing to tackle tricky projects, whether it was coding, helping classmates with their own tasks, or jumping into group work. I think they’d also say I was genuinely curious, always asking questions and aiming to understand things deeply—not just to get the right answer, but to really learn.
