# What is Platform Specific

**Platform-specific** refers to features, software, or hardware that are designed or optimized for a particular computing platform or operating system. A computing platform can refer to a combination of hardware and software that provides a framework for developing and running applications. Common platforms include operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and specific hardware architectures like x86, ARM, etc.

When something is described as platform-specific, it means that it is tailored or optimized for a particular platform and may not work seamlessly on other platforms without modification. This term is often used in the context of software development, where developers may need to create different versions of their applications to run on various platforms or make adjustments to account for platform-specific differences.

For example, a software application may have platform-specific versions to ensure compatibility and performance on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Similarly, mobile apps may be developed separately for iOS and Android platforms to take advantage of their respective features and design guidelines.
