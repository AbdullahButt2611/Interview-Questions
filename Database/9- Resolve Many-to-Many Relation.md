# How To Resolve Many-To-Many Relationship
`Netsol` `i2C`

Resolving a many-to-many relationship in a database involves creating an intermediate table, also known as a `junction table` or `linking table`, to represent the relationship between the two entities. This intermediate table typically includes foreign keys that reference the primary keys of the two entities involved in the many-to-many relationship.

Here are the general steps to resolve a many-to-many relationship:

### Identify Entities:
- Identify the two entities that have a many-to-many relationship.
### Create Intermediate Table:
- Create a new table to serve as the intermediate table.
- The table should have at least two columns, each representing a foreign key that references the primary keys of the two entities involved in the relationship.
- These foreign keys establish the connections between the entities.
### Define Foreign Key Constraints:
- Define foreign key constraints on the intermediate table, referencing the primary keys of the entities involved.
- This ensures referential integrity and helps maintain consistency in the relationships.
### Querying and Retrieving Data:
- When querying for data, you can use JOIN operations to retrieve information from both the intermediate table and the related entities.
- Use JOINs to combine data from the intermediate table with the tables representing the entities.


## Example with Students and Courses:
- Suppose you have a many-to-many relationship between students and courses. The intermediate table might be named "Enrollments" and have columns like "StudentID" and "CourseID" as foreign keys.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    Grade VARCHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)
);
```

In this example, the "Enrollments" table represents the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
