## Which approach should be used to secure and optimize JavaScript code in enterprise projects?

For one of the Bank's enterprise projects, the tech lead has asked you to secure/optimize the JavaScript files by hiding the actual names of variables and functions, making it tough to reverse engineer the functions and reducing code size. Which of the following approach would you choose? 
- Code ofscutation 
- Code minification 
- Code ofscutation and encryption 
- Code encryption 
- Code ofscutation and minification

`Turing - JavaScript`

The best choice here is:\
**✅ Code obfuscation and minification**

### Why

* **Minification**

  * Removes whitespace, shortens variable/function names, and strips comments.
  * Reduces file size → faster loading in production.
  * Slightly improves security by making code less readable.
* **Obfuscation**

  * Intentionally makes the code harder to understand and reverse engineer.
  * Changes identifiers and structure to be confusing while keeping functionality.
* **Combined**

  * You get **both** performance optimization **and** security-through-obscurity.
  * This is standard in enterprise JavaScript deployments for sensitive projects (like banking).

**Not recommended alone**:

* **Only minification** → reduces size but still somewhat readable.
* **Only obfuscation** → secures code but file size remains bigger.
* **Encryption** → browsers would need to decrypt before running, adding overhead and complexity (rarely practical for JS).

So for your bank project:

> Use **code obfuscation + minification** in your build pipeline (e.g., using Webpack + Terser + JSObfuscator).
