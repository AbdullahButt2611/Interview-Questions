# When Software is Opened What 3 Types of Memories are Made

When software is opened, various types of memories are involved in the process. Here are three main types:

### Primary Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory):

- This is the volatile memory that is used to store the currently executing programs and data that are actively being used by the software. When you open a software application, it gets loaded into the RAM so that the CPU can quickly access and process the necessary information.

### Secondary Memory (Storage, e.g., Hard Drive or SSD):

- This is the non-volatile memory where the software and associated files are stored for long-term use. When you open a software application, its executable files and related data are loaded from the secondary memory into the primary memory (RAM) for faster access by the CPU.

### Cache Memory:

- Cache memory is a smaller, high-speed type of volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications, and data. When you open software, certain parts of it may be stored in the cache memory for quicker retrieval by the CPU, enhancing overall system performance.

These three types of memory work together to ensure the smooth execution of software applications. The primary memory (RAM) provides quick access for the CPU, the secondary memory stores the software for long-term use, and cache memory helps optimize performance by storing frequently accessed data.
