# SDLC (Phases and Models)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. It consists of several phases, and different models can be used to structure and guide the development process. Here are the common phases and models in the SDLC:

## Phases of SDLC:

### Planning:

- Define the scope, objectives, and requirements of the project.
- Identify resources, timelines, and budget constraints.
- Create a project plan and feasibility study.

### Analysis

- Gather and analyze user requirements.
- Define system functionality and constraints.
- Create detailed specifications and documentation.

### Design:

- Develop the overall architecture of the system.
- Create detailed design specifications.
- Define data structures, software modules, interfaces, and algorithms.

### Implementation (Coding):

- Write code based on the design specifications.
- Conduct unit testing to ensure individual components work as expected.
- Integration of components to build the complete system.

### Testing:

- Conduct various testing types such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
- Identify and fix defects.
- Ensure the software meets the specified requirements.

### Deployment:

- Deploy the software to the production environment.
- Train end-users and provide documentation.
- Monitor the system for any issues and address them.

### Maintenance and Support:

- Address bugs and issues that arise after deployment.
- Implement updates, enhancements, and new features.
- Provide ongoing support and maintenance.

## Models of SDLC:

### Waterfall Model:

Sequential and linear approach with distinct phases.
Progresses through phases one at a time.
Suitable for well-defined and stable requirements.

### Iterative Model:

- Each iteration adds new features or refines existing ones.
- Repeated cycles of development and refinement.
- Useful for projects with changing requirements.

### Incremental Model:

- Development is divided into small, manageable parts or increments.
- Each increment delivers a portion of the functionality.
- Enables partial implementation and testing of features.

### V-Model (Verification and Validation Model):

- A variation of the waterfall model with corresponding testing phases.
- Emphasizes testing at each stage before progressing to the next.

### Agile Model:

- Adaptive and flexible approach with iterative development.
- Emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.
- Suits projects where requirements may evolve over time.

### Spiral Model:

- Combines aspects of the waterfall and iterative models.
- Iterative cycles involve risk analysis, planning, engineering, and evaluation.
- Suitable for large and complex projects with changing requirements.
