I’m constantly learning and taking on projects that push me beyond my comfort zone. Right now, I'm working on [product name], [One liner description of the product and purpose of building it] <my final year project, which blends tech and art, pushing my skills in AI and user experience design.> I’m also building my foundation in advanced topics like AI and machine learning through courses and practical applications, and I actively seek out feedback to refine my work. Mentoring others in tech also keeps me sharp, as it challenges me to explain complex concepts clearly and stay grounded in continuous learning.
