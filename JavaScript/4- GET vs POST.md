## GET vs POST Request Differences and When to Use Each
`Arbisoft`

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) supports various methods for communication between clients and servers. Two commonly used methods are GET and POST. Here are the main differences between them:

### 1. Data Submission:

- **GET:**
  - Parameters are included in the URL.
  - Data is visible in the URL, and there are limitations on the amount of data that can be sent.

- **POST:**
  - Parameters are included in the request body.
  - Data is not visible in the URL, and larger amounts of data can be sent compared to GET.

### 2. Security:

- **GET:**
  - Parameters are visible in the URL, making it less secure.
  - Not suitable for sensitive data.

- **POST:**
  - Parameters are not visible in the URL, providing a higher level of security.
  - Suitable for sensitive or private information.

### 3. Caching:

- **GET:**
  - Responses can be cached by browsers and proxies, making subsequent requests faster.

- **POST:**
  - Responses are typically not cached, as the data in the request body may vary.

### 4. Idempotence:

- **GET:**
  - Operations are generally considered idempotent.

- **POST:**
  - Operations are not necessarily idempotent.

### 5. Bookmarking and Back/Forward:

- **GET:**
  - Parameters in the URL allow for bookmarking and easy navigation using browser back/forward buttons.

- **POST:**
  - Parameters not being part of the URL can make bookmarking and navigation less straightforward.


## When to Use Which

In summary, use **GET** when:

- The request is idempotent.
- Data is not sensitive.
- The amount of data is small.
- Caching of responses is acceptable.

Use **POST** when:

- The request is non-idempotent.
- Data is sensitive.
- The amount of data is large.
- Caching of responses is not desired.

It's important to choose the appropriate method based on the requirements of the specific operation you are performing. Often, web applications use a combination of both GET and POST depending on the nature of the operation.
