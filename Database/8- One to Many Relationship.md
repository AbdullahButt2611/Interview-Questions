# One-to-many Relationship in Relation Database

In a relational database, a **one-to-many (1:N) relationship** is a type of association between two tables. This relationship occurs when each record in the first table can be related to multiple records in the second table, but each record in the second table is related to only one record in the first table.

Here's a simple example to illustrate a one-to-many relationship:

Let's consider two tables: **Authors** and **Books.**

#### Authors Table:
- **AuthorID** (Primary Key)
- **AuthorName**
- **AuthorEmail**

#### Books Table:
- **BookID** (Primary Key)
- **Title**
- **ISBN**
- **AuthorID** (Foreign Key referencing Authors table)

In this example, each author in the "Authors" table can be associated with multiple books in the "Books" table. However, each book in the "Books" table is associated with only one author.

The relationship is established through the use of foreign keys. The "AuthorID" in the "Books" table is a foreign key that references the primary key "AuthorID" in the "Authors" table. This way, you can link a book to its respective author.

This type of relationship is common in many real-world scenarios, such as one author writing multiple books while each book has only one author. In terms of database design, it helps in organizing and structuring data efficiently.
