# Difference between object oriented programming and service oriented programming? 
`Rolustech`

Object-oriented programming (OOP) and service-oriented programming (SOP) are both programming paradigms, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP):
- Focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior.
- Emphasizes concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Encourages the use of reusable and modular code through the creation of classes and objects.
- Primarily used for building applications where the interaction between different components is tightly coupled.

## Service-oriented programming (SOP):

- Focuses on creating services that perform specific functions and can be accessed over a network.
- Emphasizes concepts like services, messages, contracts, and endpoints.
- Encourages the creation of loosely coupled and interoperable components that can communicate with each other regardless of the platform or language.
- Primarily used for building distributed systems where different parts of an application are geographically distributed and need to communicate with each other.

In Summary, OOP focuses on what things are and how they are constructed, SOP focuses on what things can do.
