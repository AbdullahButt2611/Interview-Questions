# You have given 25 horses and have to find top 3 in minimum races.Only five horses can participate in a race.

To find the top 3 horses in the minimum number of races, you can follow these steps:

### Initial Races (5 races):
- Divide the 25 horses into 5 groups of 5 horses each.
- Conduct 5 races with each group, determining the fastest horse in each group.

### Identify Top Horse in Each Group:
- Take the winner from each of the 5 initial races and put them in a new race (Race 6).
- The winner of Race 6 is the overall fastest horse.

### Identify Second and Third Horses:
- Now, take the second and third-place horses from the Race 6 along with the second-place horse from each of the 5 initial races (a total of 7 horses).
- Conduct Race 7 to determine the second and third-place horses overall.

### Final Results:
- The winner of Race 6 is the fastest horse.
- The second and third-place horses from Race 7 are the second and third-fastest horses overall.

This method uses a total of 7 races to identify the top 3 horses out of 25 in the minimum number of races.
