# What is prototyping model in SDLC
`Netsol`

The Prototyping Model in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a methodology that emphasizes the iterative development of prototypes to refine software requirements and design based on user feedback. This model is particularly useful when the exact requirements of a project are not well understood at the outset.

## Key Features of the Prototyping Model

1. **Initial Prototype Development**: The process begins with gathering basic requirements from users, followed by creating an initial prototype that showcases the core functionalities of the intended software. This prototype may not include all features or the exact logic of the final product but serves as a tangible representation for users to interact with

2. **User Feedback and Iteration**: After the prototype is presented to users, their feedback is collected to identify strengths and weaknesses. This feedback is crucial for refining the prototype. The development team then revises the prototype based on user input, continuing this cycle until the users are satisfied with the design

3. **Final Implementation**: Once the prototype meets user expectations, it serves as a foundation for developing the final software product. The actual coding and implementation follow the prototype's approval, ensuring that the final product aligns closely with user needs

## Types of Prototyping
There are several approaches to prototyping, including:
- **Rapid Throwaway Prototyping**: Quickly creates a prototype to explore ideas and gather feedback, but the prototype is discarded after use.
- **Evolutionary Prototyping**: Involves incrementally refining the prototype based on continuous user feedback until it evolves into the final product.
- **Incremental Prototyping**: Breaks the final product into smaller prototypes that are developed and integrated over time.
- **Extreme Prototyping**: Commonly used in web development, it consists of creating a functional prototype with simulated data and gradually implementing all services

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### Advantages
- Increased user involvement and satisfaction due to early feedback.
- Early detection of defects and missing functionalities, reducing costs and time.
- Enhanced understanding of user requirements, leading to a better final product

### Disadvantages
- Risk of insufficient requirement analysis if too much reliance is placed on the prototype.
- Potential confusion between the prototype and the final product.
- Increased complexity and scope creep if user expectations are not managed properly

The Prototyping Model is particularly effective in environments where requirements are unclear or likely to change, allowing for a flexible and user-centered approach to software development.
