# You Have to Design a Class of Queue Using Stacks, How Will Enqueue/Push and Dequeue/Pop Work? 

To implement a queue using stacks, you can use two stacks. One stack will be used for enqueue (push) operations, and the other stack will be used for dequeue (pop) operations. Here's a simple implementation in a programming language like Python:

```python
class QueueUsingStacks:
    def __init__(self):
        # Two stacks to simulate the queue
        self.stack_enq = []  # Stack for enqueue (push)
        self.stack_deq = []  # Stack for dequeue (pop)

    def enqueue(self, item):
        # Simply push the item onto the enqueue stack
        self.stack_enq.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        # If the dequeue stack is empty, transfer elements from enqueue stack
        if not self.stack_deq:
            if not self.stack_enq:
                # Both stacks are empty, nothing to dequeue
                return None

            # Transfer elements from enqueue stack to dequeue stack
            while self.stack_enq:
                self.stack_deq.append(self.stack_enq.pop())

        # Pop from the dequeue stack to simulate dequeue operation
        return self.stack_deq.pop()
```

Here's a brief explanation:

- `enqueue(item)`: This method simply appends the item onto the enqueue stack.
- `dequeue()`: This method checks if the dequeue stack is empty. If it is, it transfers elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack, reversing their order. Then, it pops an element from the dequeue stack to simulate the dequeue operation.

This implementation ensures that the oldest element in the queue is always at the front of the dequeue stack, making the dequeue operation efficient.
