# There are three buttons in a room, you have to tell that which button turned on the LIGHT in room. you can only enter the room once.

This classic puzzle involves logical reasoning. Here's one way to approach the problem:

- Assume that only one of the buttons turns on the light.
- Randomly choose and press one button (Button 1, for example) and leave it on for a few minutes.
- After some time, turn off Button 1 and turn on Button 2.
- Enter the room and observe the conditions:
- - If the light is on, then Button 2 controls the light.
- - If the light is off but warm to the touch, then Button 1 controls the light.
- - If the light is off and cool, then Button 3 controls the light.

This strategy utilizes the fact that only one button controls the light, and the behavior of the light and the buttons can help you identify which one it is after just one entry into the room.
