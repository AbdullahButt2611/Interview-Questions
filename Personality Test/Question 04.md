## Other than yourself, who or what do you feel responsible for?

<br><br>

I feel a strong sense of responsibility toward the communities I serve and those trying to break into tech. Coming from a background shaped by migration and resilience, I know how valuable support can be. Whether it's through mentoring, building inclusive tools like [your product name], or developing tech solutions that address real needs, I aim to make a difference that extends beyond just myself.
