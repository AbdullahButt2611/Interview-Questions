## What is Object Destructuring in JavaScript?

### **Object Destructuring in JavaScript**

Object destructuring is a syntax that allows you to **unpack properties** from objects into individual variables. It makes code shorter and more readable.

#### **Basic Example**

```js
const user = { name: "Ali", age: 22, country: "Pakistan" };

// Destructuring
const { name, age } = user;

console.log(name); // Ali
console.log(age);  // 22
```

#### **Using `...` (Rest Operator) in Destructuring**

The `...` (rest) notation collects the remaining properties of the object into a new object.

```js
const user = { name: "Ali", age: 22, country: "Pakistan", role: "Developer" };

const { name, ...others } = user;

console.log(name);   // Ali
console.log(others); // { age: 22, country: "Pakistan", role: "Developer" }
```

#### **Using `...` (Spread Operator) with Objects**

The spread operator is also used to **copy** or **merge objects**.

```js
const user = { name: "Ali", age: 22 };
const details = { country: "Pakistan", role: "Developer" };

const merged = { ...user, ...details };

console.log(merged);
// { name: "Ali", age: 22, country: "Pakistan", role: "Developer" }
```
